{"name":"Atomic","tagline":"Atomic: A fork of yaaic","body":"\r\n# Atomic - a Fork of Yaaic\r\n\r\nAtomic scratches an itch I (@indrora) had: A sexy IRC client that worked.\r\nAfter trying HoloIRC, AndChat, yaaic, and several others, yaaic came the\r\nclosest and after pressure from friends, I decided to go ahead and\r\nfork yaaic.\r\n\r\nI'm changing the name to prevent clashes with yaaic, and to preserve\r\nSebastian's honour. \r\n\r\nThe last bit of the original yaaic readme is kept below;\r\n\r\nNewer icons used within are from the Android core icon pack, from Google.\r\nOstensibly, they are (C) Google, inc. They are provided free of charge\r\nto Android developers. I claim no exclusive usage of them other than to say\r\nI use them.\r\n\r\n## Things that I have changed/added:\r\n\r\n* Icons now match the Holo style (predominantly)\r\n* Highlight notification sound can be chosen from the settings\r\n* Out of pure, blinding laziness, I have cleaned house on the translations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Current/future features/changes:\r\n\r\n* Option to not hide the soft keyboard on SEND\r\n* Changing the size of the font in dp not in px\r\n* Update of all the icons\r\n* Selecting a message copies it to the clipboard\r\n* Option to not scroll when a new message appears in a channel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAtomic is based off of yaaic: Yet Another Android IRC Client.\r\n\r\nView the original project on GitHub:\r\n\r\n http://github.com/pocmo/Yaaic\r\n\r\nCheck if there' a bug there, too!\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
