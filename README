Atomic - a Fork of Yaaic

Atomic scratches an itch I (@indrora) had: A sexy IRC client that worked.
After trying HoloIRC, AndChat, yaaic, and several others, yaaic came the
closest and after pressure from friends, I decided to go ahead and
fork yaaic.

I'm changing the name to prevent clashes with yaaic, and to preserve
Sebastian's honour. 

The last bit of the original yaaic readme is kept below;

Newer icons used within are from the Android core icon pack, from Google.
Ostensibly, they are (C) Google, inc. They are provided free of charge
to Android developers. I claim no exclusive usage of them other than to say
I use them.

The application icon is derived from the CC-BA 3.0 Unported icon by Designmodo. Its details can be seen at Iconfinder:

Things that I have changed/added:

* Icons now match the Holo style (predominantly)
* Highlight notification sound can be chosen from the settings
* Out of pure, blinding laziness, I have cleaned house on the translations.


Current/future features/changes:

* Option to not hide the soft keyboard on SEND
* Changing the size of the font in dp not in px
* Update of all the icons
* Selecting a message copies it to the clipboard
* Option to not scroll when a new message appears in a channel
