The great Atomic TODO list
------------------------------------------

TODOs that would be really helpful:

 * Ability to hide join/part messages (for environments with lots of join/part)
 * a DashClock plugin (ooh!)
 * Jellybean type message buttons inside the service message.
 
 There are plenty of places in the source tree that need to be documented and
 made less insane. Much of the source takes advantage of the Android Dalvik
 runtime stack manipulation:
 
 public int foo( )
 {
	int r = 5;
	return r;
 }
 
 This causes some stack magic: r will be kicked around as a reference until it
 is used in a function call. Do this when possible.
 
 Bluesky features:
 
* Loading colorschemes from the SD card.
