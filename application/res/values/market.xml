    <string name="google_play_description">Atomic is a fork of the Yet Another Android IRC Client (yaaic).
        
Mostly, this is intended to fix and extend some of the things that made yaaic either hard to use or just plain irritating.

Changes include:
* A reworked visual style matching Holo standards
* Added options in the configuration
* Cheese Monkeys.
